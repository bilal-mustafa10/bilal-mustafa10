## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Engineer with a flair for AI innovation and a Master’s degree in Advanced Computing from King’s College London. With 3+ years of industry experience, I specialize in delivering scalable, user-first applications — from mental wellbeing apps to legal tech platforms powered by AI.

At **Cloudavian**, I engineered solutions that now support 500K+ users, re-architecting legacy systems into modern cloud-based infrastructures. Currently at **108 AI**, I’m shaping the future of legal technology through real-time contract analysis tools and collaborative AI-driven workflows.

I thrive in high-energy, fast-paced environments like **hackathons**, where I’ve earned recognition across **AI**, **legal tech**, and **accessibility** challenges. Whether I’m building smart contract generators without Solidity, simulating audience interaction with AI, or mentoring new developers, I’m driven by **impact, innovation, and continuous learning**.
